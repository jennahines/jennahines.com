<p>I lead web development projects for Columbus-area businesses, startups and organizations using HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript.  I specialize in translating static designs into responsive, highly-customized, client-friendly WordPress Themes.  I love the ever-changing world of web development which fuels my desire to learn something new everyday.</p>
<p>When I'm not building websites, you can find me walking my dogs, taking photos, trying out a new resturant, or seeking out my next vacation.</p>
